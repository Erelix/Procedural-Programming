## 1. Collatz-like Sequence Calculator

Generates a mathematical sequence from user input, where each term is modified by either halving even numbers or applying 3n+1 to odd numbers, but stops immediately if any number contains the digit '1' in its decimal representation.

## 2. Spiral Matrix Generator

Creates an N×N matrix filled with numbers. Takes a user-input integer, generates a square matrix of that size.

## 3. Hyphen Remover

Reads text from an input file,  remove hyphens between letters, and writes the modified text to an output file.

## 4. Dynamic two-way stack

Implemented dynamic two-way stack data structure. Program is an interactive menu  for pushing elements from left or right, reading/writing stack data to files, and managing memory with proper allocation and cleanup.
